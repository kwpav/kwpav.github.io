<p>In the Emacs community, there is something called <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy">.emacs bankruptcy</a>, which is when your init file gets too large and cumbersome that you need start over from scratch. As someone who tends to love messing with config files a little too much, I knew that I would eventually run into this if I started really using Emacs. That is why, when I really started to use Emacs, started with a literate config file in <code>org-mode</code> and used <code>use-package</code> for configuration.</p>
<p>It works really well, but after several years, I started to realize it was beginning to fill with cruft, my startup time seemed to be increasing, and I was running into some random issues. I have also learned a bit more about Emacs since I started, so I figured it was time to take another look at things and see what I could improve.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to declare &ldquo;bankruptcy&rdquo;, as there are still many things I want to keep, but there were some parts I knew that I needed  to clean up. So I decided to &ldquo;refinance&rdquo; &ndash; instead of starting over, I wanted to keep the core of what I had, and repay some of the &ldquo;technical debt&rdquo; I had built up. I started a new org file and copied over some of my &ldquo;base&rdquo; settings and packages.  I also decided to start only with basic Emacs stuff, no language setup. I went through the documentation of everything, removed things I thought were unnecessary, put everything I could into <code>use-package</code>, and then wrote what it does and why I was using it.</p>
<h2 id="basemacs"><code>basemacs</code></h2>
<p>After working on it for a while and seeing some posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/">r/emacs</a> asking how to build your own config like doom or spacemacs, I figured someone could get some use out of this besides me. Thus, <a href="https://github.com/kwpav/basemacs">basemacs</a> was born.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it as unopinionated as possible, it sets some sane defaults and uses a minimal set of (but what I would consider essential) packages like <code>magit</code>, <code>company</code>, <code>flycheck</code>, and <code>which-key</code>. It&rsquo;s still a work in progress: I should probably add some better documentation/description for things, I am considering adding modules, and there are probably some other things I could include and improve. But there it is, maybe someone will find it useful.</p>
