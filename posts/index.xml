      <description>Hello World v2.0 I have had some extra time on my hands in the past few months due to COVID, so one of the things I decided to do to keep my mind occupied was to restart this site. My goal is to post something every few months at least, so I wanted to come up with at least three posts before I really thought about how I was going to handle the technical side of things.</description>

      <description>One of the first things you need to do after deciding to start a blog, is setting one up. So I figured it would be appopropriate that the first post of my blog is about how I set this up.
My requirements are fairly simple:
 be able to write content using Emacs&#39; org-mode create a static site preferably written in a language I know  This led me down a path of looking at and trying a few different static site generators.</description>
